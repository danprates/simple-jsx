# Lite JSX

Lite JSX is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to create and manipulate JSX elements using only vanilla JavaScript.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to offer a lightweight and straightforward method of using JSX syntax without relying on external dependencies.

With this library, you can use JSX as a template engine for server-side rendering. The library provides three functions for generating HTML tags, formatting tag properties, and sanitizing strings to prevent XSS attacks.

The library is designed to be flexible, easy to use, and fully compatible with modern JavaScript frameworks and tools.
